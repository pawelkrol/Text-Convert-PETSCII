Revision history for Perl extension Text::Convert::PETSCII.

0.02  2013-02-16
    - added minimum required version of Perl 5.8.0 for this distribution due to
      failing unit-tests for Perl 5.6.2 which is unaware of the SIGALRM signal,
      and thus unable to correctly capture STDERR output

0.01  2011-04-22
    - initial version (provides subroutines to convert text format between ASCII
      and PETSCII character sets, and writing PETSCII character's textual
      representation to a file handle)
